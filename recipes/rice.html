            </ol>
            <p> 
                you can find the ingredients at an asian store or online 
            </p>
            <h2> Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl.
                     Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly.
                      Separate the rice into equal portions,
                     big enough to be a large handful each.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. 
                    This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take up one portion of rice in your hands. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, 
                    place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, 
                    start to press and squeeze the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so it's even.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri
                     (the rough side should face the rice) and fold 
                    it up towards to the middle of the onigiri.

                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                you can put whatever you like in it also you can search the recipe on a real website .
